According to the manufacturer this toy is for 6 YEARS and up! Fun for OLDER kids!	1

Nice shoes for a good price. Cant beat that for growing boys! And they love the easy on/off style.	1
Does not surpass War All The Time but still pretty f-ing solid. Check out Autumn Leaves Revisited.	1

Not going to purchase this set to watch them again in SD. Hopefully this stays 1 star and sells terribly.	0
For those who want designs for flowers this book has many wonderful ideas to follow, I am sure that I will be using it often.	1
Just like the original. get it. However mine said Ultrasonic, which is not shown in the picture. Lame but oh well.	1
This movie was a huge let down, if it were not for the famous actors, this movie would not have been worth watching.	0
I was really impressed with my purchase. It arrived in perfect shape,and in a very timely manner.Very good work!	1
This book dissapointed me in so far as I thought it was too academically written. It failed to capture my imagination.	0
Very poorly written. Thin plot, no character development, writing is very amateurish. Really doesn't deserve even one star.	0
An exciting tale with great imagination and characters. NOT for younger children because of violence and religious topics.	1
I bought this base for my parents and one for my house and neither one of them hold a charge. They're awful!	0
The book arrived on time with no tears and in good shape. I have no complaints about this particular product.	1
Great story. I watch it over and over to practice my Portuguese but it's such a good story, it's a joy every time.	1
Paper peeling off. Looks better in the photo that it does when it arrives. Not durable at all. I returned it.	0

The included batteries were already drained when I put them in my camera after charging them for 24 hours!	0
The socks did not warm my feet and only when worn for hours did I feel any heat from the heating elements	0
My daughter loves this show! I love how it gets her involved and she learns at the same time as she's being entertained.	1
Looked at similar products in stores, but they were small this one cooks 4 sandwiches at once. Great product.	1

I wish I could review this product. I ordered it over thirty days ago and it still has not arrived at my door.	0
I love this CD, it's excellent party music, I always play this cd at partys along with HI-voltage bass	1
My 6 year son and I enjoyed every minute of it. Great workout! It also teaches my son some smoothe hip hop moves.	1

This is one of the best plays that I've seen. It is well written and extremely funny.	1
A tour-de-force of style and substance -- one of the funniest, best-written novels I've read in a long time.	1
this is a very nice pencil that won't disapoint you. the lead is impossible to break and it ships rather QUICKLY.	1
A great magazine subscription for kids. My daughter grew out of it at about age 12 but I highly recommend this.	1
FULL of ads, hardly any content at all. Not worth paying for it.	0
Don't even bother getting this. It is like reading one big ad to your children.	0
interesting video. would recommend it if you want to learn basic card counting and more.	1
So interesting and so well done! This is a great DVD> Anyone over 45 will have a trip down memory lane! An excellent tranfer too!	1
this is visual reading of gods word and I love itIt helps me visualize the book of Luke correctly	1
The product is very comfortable but it can be more useful if it was bigger, I am using it in a restaurant.	1
FAST EFFICIENT SERVICES FROM SHIPPER. I ADDED THIS TO MY LIBRARY ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT READ IT YET. WOULD USE THIS SHIPPER AGAIN	1
I was surprised by the ending but the movie itself was so slow moving and hard to stay interested. I've seen way better.	0
I was hoping this would be a little more like the classic game and I was disappointed.	0
Learned of Sufferer, A Survivor Parody, in Forbes (Jan. 8th, 2001 issue) and couldn't be happier with it.	1
Simple, very fast, no hassle, no problems - the perfect purchase. Makes shopping a pleasure.	1
This is a great book with lots of valuable information. It can be a great reference for skin care professionals.	1

My husband has a time finding a hat big enough & this one was perfect! fits great & looks great!	1
I didn't need such a technical guide..I was expecting it to be written freindlier.	0
The material is soft and smooth and it feels ok but a g-spot toy would be alot better... Maybe a tad too long.	0
There is one problem, packing before Cd was striped. But the songs are very beautiful. I recommend it highly.	1
would have been a great buy, but one side of the audio connection is not working.	0
...The light is so dim and doesnt even shine on the screen properly.Also the magnifier makes it worse....	0
Very good game. Easy to learn. Recommend this game to all the star trek lovers out there	1
If you ever have house guest over that you want to leave... just put in this CD. Its a mess.	0
I used it in a steam cleaner and it worked pretty good. Had to go over the carpet area 2X though.	1
I quit about halfway through this book. Making fun of people does not hold my interest and is not humorous.	0
Listen to this CD before jumping out of a tenth story window. It will give you the courage.	0
the item i recieved had prompt shipping. It was in a sealed case, i would buy from this seller again	1
This is one of the best cd I have ever got, each song is vary good and there is not one bad song on the disc.	1
Had to replace identical battery (would not hold charge) after very limited use that came with my drill.	0
This is a clever romantic comedy that has something for everyone. Great for some laughs, a good story and movie to relax with.	1
This is really a wonderful movie to watch. Visually it is beautiful-just plain good story telling about real events.	1
Dogs carry these around and have not destroyed them after two weeks. That is good.	1
My puppy loves this little toy -- I just wish it were brown instead of grey -- it looks too much like a mouse!	1
great little toy for my dogs. i have yorkies so they love it and it comes with an extra squeaker.	1
This was a nice product. There isn't much to be said in a review. Wood trim looks nice, I would recommend.	1

This was bought for a 9 year old as a gift and he is very very happy with the game and the condition it came in.	1
The three earlier reviews pretty much say it all. I agree 100% and wanted to add another 5 star rating.	1
The product was easy to make however the moving pieces are easy to break than the product explains.	0
A great book to understand what green and sustainable environment exactly mean! a lot of good informations.	1
Does what it needs to do---but has a slow leak so must be reinflated every 24 hours. That's a disappointment.	0
Got a good deal on it, its popular, tastes good, and was shipped and arrived on time. Thanks!	1
it's optimum nutrition's 100% whey protein .it's a great basic protein shake .can't ask for more . .	1
Some people do not like the taste of this one but I do and think it goes well with the soy milk that I mix it with.	1
Delicious! I would recommend this product. It tastes great and mixes well with milk. No lumps or anything like that.	1
I love this one as much as The Wee Free Men. You not only have to read it, you have to own the book.	1
It is not what I expected... I am very disappointed with it!I was expecting more drawing and clear pictures...	0

great read if you are interested in whats going to happen after oil runs out, everyone should read	1
It's cool it has adventure and action even a bit of romance too! Random words random words to meet repuirements	1
We've only used the meat grinder, not the pasta attachment yet. So far, so good.	1
A nice set of creme brulee pans. Very sturdy, clean well, better price than I could fins anywhere else, in-store or online.	1
Most tacky movie I have seen in a long time. There is one good line and the rest is pretty sad.	0
One of the weaker offerings from Monty Python. Not really worth watching, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is far better.	0
This KitchenAid bowl w/handle is a must have with any kitchenAid mixer period. My wife loves it!	1
Not a lick of problems. We ground some berries and made some great bread. I recomend this to all!	1
Had a hard time finding these bulbs. Was glad to find them here and got them in a hurry. Very satisfied.	1
I agree with the others... better check some chessex dice sets. I personally suggest speckled fire or nebula flame.J.	0
An excellent product. I bought one for my mom, then tried it, and bought one for myself. A great back support.	1
I am very pleased with my purchase. It was as advertized. I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will work great.	1

Love the traditional songs and the ""kiddie"" singing like ""all I want for Christmas is My 2 Front Teeth"". Classic!!	1
A timeless classic that never goes out of style. Everyone should reach t at least once in their lifetime for sure.	1
Item came shipped in a manageable size box, on-time, and ready to put on the tractor. It couldn't have been easier!	1
I saw the movie on TV for the first time in a long time so I thought I needed to read the book and wasn't disappointed.	1
This is a very biased book full of neoconservative ideology and very few facts....	0
A book to read & re-read. Finely crafted & evocative of a now long ago & far away time and place.	1
did not really work was more or less just loud. when u talked into it, your voice did not change	0
I think I wasted my money on this. Every setting sounds the same, which is not much differnt than your real voice.	0

For a PS 1 game the graphics are outstanding and there's a pretty good challenge to the game.	1
Not one of his best efforts - drags a bit - he is at his best with Stone Barrington stories.	0

This is a great reference book. A good read for those seeking trivia. Glad I have it.	1
Doe's what it says. I have three cars in storage and have not had a problem.	1

This book does give you the important structure behind proofs and the methodology needed to produce them yourself.	1
This is the miniature edition, which is a hugely abridged version of the paperback book!	0

mine was broken and out of its package when i got it, im going to order a different one, mabey it was just that one time	0
My daughter plays with these constantly. They are sturdy and seem like they can take the abuse my children inflict on them.	1
I have used Microsoft Office for PC in the past. This product for the MAC is great.	1

Chuck does his thing backed up by the Steve Miller Band!Good stuff--""...just reelin' and a-rockin'...""	1

A nice diffuser that gives light from your flash unit a nice warm tint, lighting your subject with natural looking light.i like it.	1
It was the wrong book. It was older then I was led to believe. Also picture was no the same as what was sent	0
Very good source of information. I will most likely buy other books in this series.	1
One of the bags is already tearing on the side. Oh well, what do you expect for $2.95.	0
Have to say i enjoyed this movie for it's true to life story line. The casting was excellent as well.	1

I really enjoyed reading this book, it really held my interest. I would give it more stars if I could.	1
Great late Art. Full of energy and stretching his creativity. One of the best rhythm sections he has played with.	1
This is my third bottle and I have dozen others but this I keep going back to. Excellent fragrance.	1
this was a very high quality power cord, very inexpensive. Did exactly what I wanted it to do. Would recommend it to anyone.	1

I thought this movie was very ordinary,i kept waiting for something to happen, maybe it's me or Tim Roth's acting !!!	0
This CD was very helpful for my meditation. I also play it when I go to bed.	1
This thing does not deserve many words. Typical alien abduction silliness.Give me a break!	0

This dvd is NOT the one to pick if you are looking for some great laughs! Sober Richard Pryor is sadly not funny.	0

This is a cute, convenient-to -use product that works perfectly. And what a great price!	1
Great box set, enjoyed watching it, we'll worth it. Would recommend the box set to any fan or casual fan.	1

I cant believe Julia would do a movie like this. It's boring, trashy, dirty, confusing, and just awful!	0
Where the heck is the soundtrack for this movie? Or at least who sings the song and the end?	1
I would recommend Laura Levine to anyone who like cozy mysteries. They are hilarious and a wonderful ready every time.	1
Simply one of the best films ever, and displays why Howard Hawks is one of the all time masters of the medium.	1
These cranberries have a wonderful texture and flavor. The will make a great addition to my trail mix and sugar rolls.	1

Another great book. Filled with nostalgic and informative profiles of dozens of plants that are great to grow and share.	1
I never received the ordered item, but a charger instead. They failed to respond to my email.	0
Jennifer Lopez had her 15 minutes of fame, now it is time to move on. this set of songs does not do it.	0
This film is very enjoyable to anyone with an interest in Science Fiction. It is a typical Stephen King classic,	1
Good CD that demonstrates the old, west coast style of hip-hop. One of 2Pac's great albums, with great lyrics and mellow beats.	1
This movie had quite a few nice twists. I liked the development of some of the actors.	1
50 Cent's best ablum. I don't see how people can hate on 50, he's rich, he's tough and his lyrics are tight. GG G-unit	1
These pans work very nicely. Heat evenly and fast. Love the glass covers. price was right. Would recommend anyone to purchase.	1
It smells good.My dog loves this.The price is right.And it has low fat.What else can I say?	1

This recording is dreadful; sounds like cats and dogs howling in an echochamber somewhere off in Montana.	0
Again, the title of this review says it all. Too bad HBO didn't do a fourth season!	1
Excellent book, it is like talking to grandpa, you get great advise and good little anticdotes from a long history of golf.	1
Says all that is obvious, a guide book for idiots. Renews nothing. A total waste of time (not much but still a waste).	0

You can't read this book or series without it stimulating personal spiritual reflection. That is a real bonus these days.	1
Somewhat outdated, rehashed and self aggrandizing. More historical than cutting edge. You can do better!!	0
Easy to install and very stable. The folding latch is quite strong and takes some effort to unlatch, not a bad thing though.	1
The strength of the magnet is perfect. I never have a hard time getting them off or putting them on. Looks great too	1

What I thought N synk was where my dirty dishes were last spotted.where are they. I sure didn't clean 'em.	0

Unfaithful is a lousy movie.It has an old insipid plot that has been told a thousand times before.	0
Okay stirred into a strongly flavored soup or stirfry, but on its own it has a very unpleasant metallic taste.	0
Scared me to death when I was a child. Much better plot than the 2 copy cat pictures afterwords. More suspensful.	1
Why not just get #1 Record/Radio City? It has all these and alot more. Duh.	0

This magazine is just plain silly.I think it is geared toward 14-16 year olds who are trying to find themselves.	0
This movie is pure propaganda and was very twisted to get a very obvious liberal point of view out.	0
I had seen this before, and I wanted to give my children a chance to see it. They loved it. A fun, feel-good movie.	1
The video was here on time and was in excellent shape and a lot more entertaining than we remembered 20 years ago!!	1
This movie is great and that is why I bought it but, for some reason, this DVD was in black and white. I returned it.	0
A terrific Cd of American favorites and new titles as well.	1

this book compelled me to read other books by sandra brown. a really good one. it deserve more than 5 stars.	1
It is by no means a one day detox program. The title is very misleading and unfair to the unknowing.	0

one of the best books of john likacs about sir winston the other being five days in london .	1
It was one of my favorite books when I was in middle school and decided to finally buy my own copy and read it again.	1

These are really good speakers and they're not too expensive. I am very happy with my purchase.	1
if you buy this game well then return it. its is the worst ddr ever made. you should stay with ddr:konamix	0
Every bit as good as my $60 (and half the length) Monster Cable! Do not hesitate to buy this.	1

These are all well made, have rubber handles that are over sized so that they are easier to grip.	1
Great book. Very addicting. Had a hard time pitting it down. Now working on the other books in the series	1

this bratz is soooo ugly i mean come on white hair?If i were you i would not get this!	0
This is an awesome CD. It includes the smash hit, ""I Did It"", which, alone, would make the CD well worth buying.	1
the wraps would not stay straight, constanly rolling, flimsy feeling, stretched so out of place they lost its look, won't order again.	0

I am dismayed after buying this from amazon. They have promised ear bud headphones but have provided the dated common headphones.	0
John has an easygoing style which is easy to read. Very informative and disturbing food for thought.	1
The author is determined to write one cliche after another.The best I can say about this book is that it is boring.	0

This works so much better that the manual opener I used to have,and the rechargeable battery is great also.	1
A quick and easy way to get the cork out of the bottle and the wine into the glass. Highly recommend this opener.	1
The electric wine opener is a boon to everyone who has ever struggled with a stubborn cork.	1
Its pretty cool but slow. I can open a bottle by hand faster but its fun to bring out when I have company.	1
This is a very sleek looking wine opener, but not so easy to use. We finally returned the opener.	0
Worked great for about a month and then it broke. The screw pull just broke off. It must be defective.	0

I didn't like it. Not much happened and the funny parts weren't funny. Read something else.	0
I expected it to be much funnier. Seems like they tried too hard to be funny. Too many characters too.	0
Nothing new. predictable story, unimpressive script, dont waste money on this. If it comes up in prime, watch it to kill time	0

I love this CD. I really did not like the blues until I listen to this CD. I enjoy every song.	1
Five stars for the product. Minus one star because it had a little dent when it arrived.	1
The filters were shipped the next day and arrived a few days later. They work perfectly.	1
I love to bowl and these are great shoes. Product came on time and quality is good.	1
CD works great and wasn't scratched or damaged. The case was cracked and a bit dirty but the CD was fine.	1
Very attractive but it requires a bit work to put them up if you buy the ones with a lock. Not impossible but definetly tricky.	1
The Journey concert was canceled due to the lead singer being ill. This was a way for the family to make up for it.	1
This ladle should work great for canning and frying as it is wide, and very well balanced.	1
Great movie for my Ethics class to watch and discuss the various ethical theories and how they play out in the movie.	1

Fun game! Wish the cards were a little thicker but a good product for this day and age (disposable).	1
the DVD color is very poor in comparison with the VHS version. It's watchable but only if you like the movie and the actors.	0
I bought this for several men in my family for Christmas. When I received it I was very pleased with the quality of the item.	1
I just really enjoy this movie. it flows well, is funny, sweet and leaves me feeling great. I highly recomend.	1

Exciting to the end. Great fantasy. Hard to put down. I think I liked this book the best of the three	1
This is one of my favorite movies and I was excited to find it to purchase as I have been unable to find it in the stores.	1
this is a richly imagined, often deeply funny, book about a deadly serious subject. highly recommended!	1
cover fits very well. Someone else saw it & liked it. seems they were going to get one.	1
This movie was horrible. I hated it. Its the worst Marvel movie out so far. Its very bad. I do not recommend this!	0
everthing is good, the movie play witn no problem and the price was awesomw, thanks	1
Disc was fine, but box came cracked and pieces broken off. Maybe a cushion packaging next time. No harm done though!	0

Workbook was brand new, came in the time promised and was exactly what we wanted!	1
I purchased the cd because I wanted the song 70's Love Groove. I now ENJOY that SENSUAL Love song on my IPOD. Thanks.	1
No particular reason other than these are not very good songs. Nothing worth listening to more than once. Case closed	0
Great people to deal with! Excellent communication! Super fast shipping. Thanks so much!	1
I really enjoyed this game. You can use the wii control to cast charms... The best is that it can be played by two players.	1
The funniest movie I have ever seen! If you're looking for a good laugh, I highly suggest watching this movie!	1
I love this movie which is why I bought it. The movie was delivered within days.	1
This movie was stupid. Cheesey lines, bad plot, and the romantic twist with that Baldwin guy was just pathetic.	0
It's wonderful to have a TV show I can sit down and watch with my teenage daughter that we both enjoy.	1
This is one of the best of the Women's Murder club series and included good dialog between the women investigators.	1
It's action packed and never a dull momentAlso it keeps getting better once you start reading it's hard to put it down	1
First time i used it, it dripped all over the counter..tried again with same results, sent it back. I got a LEMON.	0
I am always amused by pathetic technical books but this one has got to take the cake. Well done.	0

The dehumidifier stopped working after one year and 15 days when it was out of warranty. They are not build to last.	0

Radiohead without the emotion. Oasis without the tunes. Mark Knopfler without the lyrics.	0
Extremely easy to read and understand. The section on charts is exceptional!	1

Demille is my favorite author but couldnt get into this book at all- was completely implausible story line for me	0
Hot, Hot, Hot ! Mind blowing music for Belly Dance especially if you want to try something new. Great for choreography !	1
This is as bad if not worse than their first book. I was hoping for something better but was sorely disappointed.	0
I really like Stephanie Zimbalist but I just did not like the story. Her performances in Remington Steele were fabulous.	0
The Thunderpuss mix was disappointing. I like the red disc with the Rauhofer mix and the Red Square Mix the best.	0
Savini is wasted. The Living Dead concept is wasted. It's an incoherent mess. The less said about it the better.	0
Don't miss this one. Hard Bop at it's best. Cannonball's playing is amazing as usual. Live jazz in 1960 was never better.	1
I find the dvd very informational and learned things i did not know about Rick Springfield.	1
The idea is good, but it's not that useful. It is too big for a lot of washers, also it will make damage to the dryer.	0
I have the LP set purchased in the 1960's. It was great to see that it is on CD so that I don't have to wear out my LPs.	1
This has got to be the cheapest made stock I have ever seen I do not recommend it and am going to just throw it away!	0
This dvd is awesome great to be able to watch this hilarious programme over and over again.	1
This show is refreshing and hilarious! A must have for anyone who likes music, off the wall humor and many puns!	1
I sent it to my ""Literacy Buddy"" in a pre-k program. He had requested a book about trucks. He liked it.	1
wow... that was the worst excuse for punk i have ever heard. i do like punk, but punk this isn't.	0
I took the author to long to get to the point. She went all around in circles to get to the point	0
This is a total RIP OFF. The add very clearly states 5 pound box and what you get is a 0.5 pound tube. NEVER AGAIN!!	0
like all great fables, this one speaks to all of us. find this little book.	1
I got this as a extra with my sharpening stone and it does its job! A little pricey for the size would be my only gripe.	1
EVERY FEMALE AND MALE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK.... TIM KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!!! I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR NEXT BOOK...	1
Ick. what an odd bunch. Too much! I got this on recommendation of a co-worker but the families in this are sooo odd!	0
Does not work in Vista. I liked the game in earlier versions of Windows, but it simply will not load in Vista.	0
It brought back plesant memories of my college and military years.	1
This is a fantastic disco-inspired production. The best so far from Dimitri from Paris.	1
Very cute but unfortunately it is cheaply made. The handle broke immediately. Be aware that it is very tiny too.	0
I enjoyed this show but power rangers and vr troopers were better in my opinion, but i can't wait to own this show too.	1
I Have more than 7 year using this A+D Diaper Rash cream for my Kids and if the best for the girls.	1

I absolutely love this movie! This is Tom Hanks at his absolute best. I watch it over and over again!	1
This product was so noisy I could hear it all over the house and the cats were terrified of it.	0
My cat always tried to drink from the tub spout, but now that she has this she hasn't bothered. She loves it.	1
It is a good pillow. A little bit hard for my son to compress it nicely. It is light and takes little room if compressed well.	1
Worst Product I've ever purchased on here. Pain to setup. Didn't work at all. returning it.	0
This product works gteat. I did need yo download the Vista driver from thr D0_link site.	1
My boys have been wanting the Oddessey on dvd forever, and its only been found on old VHS. Why the wait for dvd?	1
I would love to review this item, but since it has not been sent to me, I cannot. I am very displeased with this situation.	0
Not for what was described. Do not purchase. Stay away from this useless product. Never was able to use it.	0
Still impressed by this series! Loving the new characters and the supsense of the story line. Great purchase for sure!	1
I was lookiing for understanding the behavior, not a text book on the brain. Not so much help in the real world.	0
The imagem is very good. It's a great production. I consider it a good film, although there are some silly dialogs.	1
If you like the great old B horror movies, you will like this movie. This is one that I hadn't seen before.	1
This is a beautiful story,wonderfully written. The characters are so real,I can't wait to read the next book in this series.	1
This book is great. It is easy to read and follow the story line. To go on a mental vacation.	1
Not satisfactory for either chair we have. Removed the ""table"" portion and it fits the arms OK.	0
But it's still Dex and so worthwhile. But get Our Man in Paris and Doin' Alright first.	0
Est-ce que j'ai manquer un épisode??? Un changement pas vraiment interessant... decevant	0
Just like I remembered as a kid. Fun show, however I didn't remember the animation quality being as poor as it was.	1
This video is a workout video full of smaller workouts, so you can mix and match the workout. It has yoga, pilates, and so on.	1
The price was right. I had looked for this movie because I loved the classics.I like your competitive marketing and pricing	1
its not all that you think it is in my opinion I'd rather buy a 1 cent playstation game and play it instead	0
Just got done with it and gotta say it was a good book. It explained why a lot of things happened the way they did.	1
It is good to see classic acts of patriotism that endure the passage of time and remind us of better times.	1
It's rude, often humorous, and sometimes laugh out loud. What more do you want from animation?	1
Got this for a friend who likes anime, he seemed to have really liked it cause he kept asking me for more.	1
For some reason my 1 year old loves this, probably because he can make the horse jump. Otherwise its pretty mediocre.	0
Bought this for my grandkids who love Tom & Jerry. They love it! This is the traditional Tom & Jerry.	1
Kushner is a thoughtful writer and those interested in ""living a life that matters"" should read this book!	1
Not much to say since this was purchased for my son as one of his text books for school. He thought it was very helpful.	1
Just started using it again, I stopped and things got worse, so I started up again and things have gotten better	1
A new person out there for me to listen to. A beautiful voice, with so much soul. Will buy more of her music.	1
I love this show I watched it when it first came on tv and I was sad that they didn't make a second season.	1
after lots of research this seemed like the best option but it is really loud. would not buy again.	0
Total POS. It broke the first day using it. The side split right acros the bottom. Can't believe this ever sold.	0
Not very valuable. Each chapter is very short and very shallow. Not much to this book at all. I would not recommend it.	0
Cant say enough abouth this book. One of the best books on intercession and faithI have ever read next to the Bible	1
the book is put together in a very easy reading format. I would recomend it to anyone for a study guide.	1
This book was a gift for a ""Harley enthusiast"". He was thrilled with the information as well as the photos!	1
These books are nicely bound, but the sealed paper doesn't play well with fountain pens. Beware!	0
there are lots of recipes for herbs, but as a beginner, I found the book unhelpful. Not what I had in mind at all.	0
could not download my numbers to the device and tech support was not helpful. I have an LG phone.	0
I was very disappointed with this book. I provided little more than a handout. Book description given online was very misleading.	0
When my other charger broke I was able to pick up a new one at Amazon. I love the ease of using Amazon.	1
I remember hearing this album while growing up with an older brother & sister. I love his voice and the music of this album/CD.	1
The product arrived quicky, was easy to assemble and operate. It works very well in my garden and I'm very pleased with it.	1
A funny as well as inspirational book that even has some good recipes in it as a bonus. Worth the read!	1

They never shipped my order, and then canceled it almost a week later. Thanks for wasting my time.	0
I am very pleased with CD. It is a wonderful trip back to young memories. Mario Lanza,'s voice is timeless.	1
I agree, the knives get spotty rust marks using regular Cascade dishwashing soap in normal water. This is clearly unacceptable.	1
Chow Yun Fat and John Woo are a winning combination for action. Very stylish and well filmed.	1
Never read bond, but have watched movies. Not the same but never the less enjoyable.A good place to start.	1
I wish this were true, but it's bunk. Grieving is a difficult business, and we should not try to pretend we're still in touch.	0
Great set love the collector cards that come with it!! Love the preview of Deathly Hallows!!	1

I hated this book with a heated passion. Some of my classmates loved it, but I would have rather burned it.	0
IF you like rambling, unfocused, left wing propaganda you will love this one. It's boring and typical Grisham now.	0
An very enjoyable read! I would definitely recommend it for a ""light"" read and will look for that author again!	1
Was refreshing,fun and hard to put down. Not the usual who done it, and not full of sex. Just fun reading.	1
This book is wonderful... smart, funny; everyone will get something out of it! A must read!	1

Sure to go down on record as an all time UB40 classic album. Fan of the band or not, you will really love this.	1
The book has no pictures. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get this information when you purchase in Amazon.	0
Cheap yet sturdy and makes great rice. I've tried only white basmati and it made flawless pilaf. Very happy with the purchase.	1
This is an awesome photo quality printer!!It is hard to tell the 'real' photo from the Epson	1
Although it has some good info, it is a tad dry to read. Too much fluff for a study guide	0

If you are a fan of ballad laden guitar driven hair spray rock then this is your ticket to flashback heaven...	1
If you like murder mysteries, this one is just ok. I could not really get into it, and I tried.	0
this cd is awesome. i listened to it for about 3 months before taking it out of the player.	1
Amazing voices blend so well and the selections are in Italian, but I know the songs, so can sing along in English.	1
This book was very confusing to even get started on for me. Found a much better book to help me understand.	0
This was a good story if you like Danielle Steel and I really enjoyed. It was better than alot of others I've seen.	1

Set up easy. Mouse takes some getting use to, but was a good buy. Would recommend this product and seller.	1
The mouse button is not very easy to use and my keyboard stopped working after 2 years(yes, i check the batteries)	0
I don't like this product. The keyboard function did not work consistency. The pointer did not work.	0
THE ONLY GOOD PART OF THE MOVIE WAS THE PART WHERE P LOOKED LIKE A GIRL!!!!!!!	0
I bought this cover for my 1st generation Kindle, but it is sized for the 3rd generation model. Very aggravating!!	0

due to bad package book twisted and pages damaged.please be more careful .. . . . . . . . . .	0
First time I sprout broccoli. It's easy and fast. I'm very satisfy with this product. I will definitely buy this product again.	1

Well, I would love to buy this dvd, but it is WAY too expensive. Is anyone listening out there?	0
This is a small radio that fits in my bathroom drawer when not in use. The sound is excellent.	1

This is a awesome DVD, It makes sense of the book of Genesis in the BIBLE,puts it in to perspective.	1
I had no idea this book would be so informative. Very good read, changed my perspective.	1
But not quite as big as the advert makes it look. Regardless, a cute, nice piece of jewelery that can go with practically anything.	1
I like the way it was written (as a diary). I couldn't stop laughing. I can't wait to see the movie and read the sequel.	0
Enjoyed the story very much. It was funny and suspensful all at the same time. It is an easy read.	1
Fun to watch. Not Academy Award movie or acting, but just a good, fun western to end a busy day. Enjoyable.	1
A wonderful show to watch that you and the kids can enjoy. John Wayne and others a good wholesome western	1

this version is missing the qoute ""why would you wear suspendoers and frank shoot's him. Paramont should be ashamed.	0

The goblet does not have a smooth stainless steel finish giving it an everyday look. Ok for camping or the cottage.	0
Great informational book, it transcends time and place for the fire department. Def. recommend.	1
For a short book, fewer than 100 pages, it is one long, bad, boring read. Save yourself; don't read it if you don't have to.	0
I gave this to my friend who is expecting and loved it!. My friend seemed very pleased and is anxious to put a picture in it.	1
great deal, wi-fi, video, clear audio and with new upgrades it becomes even more perfect.	1

When you're in the zone, you know it. Clearly, Lucas needs to be told he is NOT in the zone. Somebody say something!	0

After an hour continually restarting as a microscopic plankton or whatever, I just give up, this game is annoying.	0
Stay away from this game, very poor compatibility and DRM causes this disc to not work in many systems.	0

I didn't realize how helpful a spoon like this could be for mixing drinks until I got one for my bar set. Awesome!	1

Interesting cookbook. In our area we are very limited to many of the ingredients that we can buy.	1
Like so many consumer products these days, this item was designed to fail. One more for the Ralph Nader list....	0
A very bigoted book that blames the poor for not following the rules she has decided are essential.	0
This is a well thought out book about poverty and conceptions/misconceptions. I is by now a classic.	1

Never responds to whistles, or respond to random sounds. Go for the more expensive models, this one doesn't cut it.	0
Great Irish contemporary music. The harps, pennywhistles and bodhran drums make you think of the Irish countryside.	1
If your not sure ... purchase it! It is the most wonderful dreamy music. Price is great also.	1
I enjoyed this CD. Why do i have to write 14 words , if all i have to say is that i liked the product?	1
boring from beginning to end. I tried not to fall asleep while watching it. Watched once never again would waste my time.	0
the publishers must be high if they think anyone is gonna pay that for an ebook.	0
The book is very helpful. I have referenced it many times and will take it with me to the hospital for my childbirth.	1
clutch fit and looked nice out of the box, but all it does is slip and grind. it smokes, discolored the drum. complete CRAP.	0
I got the movie on time. As this is a present for someone I have not watched it. I will let you know later.	1
Not as good of a fit as an OEM part but at a fraction of the cost, it does the job well.	1
The book ""The Teacher who couldn't read"" , started to slow all to the mid. but as I read along I couldn't put it down.	0

Looks and feels like a good seat cover; however, it was too small for my bike so I had to return it.	0

The Garmin comes off the gimbal a bit too easily. The mount hugs the dashboard nicely.	1
This friction mount work great. You will never think of using the sucktion cups again.	1
Like the flexibility and it certainly stays in place. Would like it to be smaller, easier to stash away.	1
This is wonderfully engineered and sticks like glue to the dashboard. Beats a windshield mount in every way.	1
I had another ""adjustable base"" mount and it just didn't work for me. I love this one! It works as described.	1
This friction pad is great...it stays comfortably on the dashboard without slipping and is very flexible to use.	1
Easy to use. Works well on both truck and SUV dash. Superior to using the suction cup mount.	1
It is exactly what I expectived. It can be moved around on the dashboard and still support the GPS unit.	1
A better way to mount the GPS on the dash. You can move it to different locations on the dash and to other vehicles.	1
For the price, you can get all the info in this book by searching free web sites. Not worth the money! I felt cheated.	0
The trap does not work because the cage door arrived bent. Thus the door does not slide shut.	0

The film is very good, but the the quality of the pictures, colours are very bad. It should be remastered.	0
Well made, great price, will give you many years of dependable service. Your birds will thank you.	1
This is my favorite sleep-time tea. Works better than any other sleep-tea product. Tastes great!	1
Good 90's movie with Cruise and Pitt. A great Vampire story before the Twilight crazy of the late 2000's. Definitely a good buy.	1
The sleep guard did not keep my mouth open enough at night. My jaws still clenched tight.	0

This is really a necessity for the commode seat, no more wiggling ever.Great product and great Amazon service, great price.	1
This movie fits that weird late 60's and early 70's genre that I abhor. Wouldn't waste my time to watch this again.	0
This is a wonderful knee strap that stays in place when I run and greatly helps the knee pain I am having.	1
This movie sucks. Probably one of Kilmer's worst roles ever. There are absolutely no redeeming qualities to be found here.	0
IT WAS GREAT TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE GAME IN THE TIN SO THE CARDS STAY PRESERVED. THE GAME IT SELF IS SO MUCH FUN TO PLAY.	1

This is a good idea, but the product does not stand up to its appraisals.	0
It disturbs me that AMAZON keeps selling items after they are clearly lemons!!	0
The movie is really funny but it is not worth the money for a 20 min dvd. This dvd should be half the cost.	0
It doesn't work at all, even when it was new. Buy a crate of beer for $40 and you will save yourself the frustration.	0
This is just like the one that broke. Of course that one lasted for 3 years with daily use. Good luck with your purchase.	1
I am sooooo happy with the book. Thank you so much. I remember the bookfrom when I was living in PR.	1

this cushion is good for the price, the shiatsu mode is great, only down side is the auto shut down after 15 minutes.	1

The product description is inaccurate. This key does NOT fit the DA3000R, and may not fit others listed.	0
Simple little stories with a nice repeating theme, great illustrations. A fine addition to any child's library.	1

Ted The movie would not download and what did download was unwatchable. I am disappointed this was my forst try and probably last.	0
Ted, will leave you laughing on the floor laughing. He is raunchy, perverted, and lacks any type of manners.Cute movie.	1
We couldn't even finish the movie! It was stupid, not funny and a waste of my money and time, period!	0
Lots of pot smoking and the f word a lot. Certainly not for kids of any age. Had some odd sexual things too.	0
I If you like foul mouthed teddy bears you'll love this farce but for me. It was wasn't worth the rental price	0

Perhaps one of the funniest martial arts films you'll see. I was dying from laughter the entire time.	1
The book was in excellent condition and I am a great fan of the series. i would buy here again.	1
The entire video is only ten minutes long!The price is in no way justified for thisbrief introduction.	0

i call these flicks fast forward or f... fail.two days after watching it i couldnt recall what its all about.avoid.	0
not written very well; to much shooting; nice special effects;shallow, story not developed well, not as good as the original	0
Not as good as original but it did have lots of action. Why is there a minimum amount of words to these reviews?	0
Other than special effects this movie has very little going for it. I was not sympathetic to the characters at all.	0
These cups did not come with handles, and the spouts are green, not white. Not what I thought I ordered. Very disappointed.	0

I work a 12 hour shift and my coffee stays not warm, but hot throughout my work day. Love it.	1
Take it from someone who listened to these songs everyday on the radio, this compilation is bad. Nothing is original.	0
Save your money, it only last 2 days and thats with a kid sitting on it. The part of the float that you sit on falls off.	0
It was so comfortable but it broke the 1st day. The vinyl connection to the leg rest is obviously flimsy	0

Better than I expected. Hassle free easy access and great quality picture. Have only been thru Season 1 without any flaws	1
Sons of Anarchy season 1 is awsome. Katey Sagal is a strong lead along with Charlie Hunnam and Ron Perlman.	1
Kids loved this one. They are still watching it all the time.I felt it was more of a Halloweenish kind of movie.	1
The story line was good, but it wasn't as humorous and creative as I expected it to be. I was just ok.	0
Have played this version of Monopoly 5 days now, it is great, options keep it fresh, very enjoyable to play.	1

From the previews you think you know what Looper is all about, but there is a twist. I liked it.	1

I really didn't like this movie to well, it dragged on and off through the whole movie. the ending was the best part of the movie.	0
I loved this movie. Action, suspense and a little romance thrown into the mix as well. Bruce Willis was wonderful.	1
This headset is confortable and the works great. Feed line is adequate in length and allows for some mobility. Sounds great.	1

Exploded inside from the first useAnd I wasted my time reading how to use itDidn't last one day afterall	0
Great product. Feels and looks great on the bike! Totally recommend it. Good, dependable and easy to install. Nice texture also.	1
You get your romance and mushy stuff all wrapped up in an action packed, drug lord, Mexican stand off package. A must see!	1
2 men sharing a women I found weird but perhaps that might be what the present average viewer enjoys. The whole move stunk.	0
It was way better than expected due to some of the negative feedback...and ended up buying to watch again thru Amazon	1
What can I say... Michael Ball's voice just cannot be compared to anyone else. This cd is just one more example of his talent.	1
Vital reading especially for those of the present generation that were fortunate enough to have missed the horrows of World War II.	1
Much smaller than expected and cheap material gives a feeling that it may easily break. But anyway the product works as described.	0
This movie is great.You won't be disappointed.Perfect for dates and the soundtrack is great!	1

Some songs are good (especially ""Straight Up""), but some songs aren't as good. Anyway, it's pretty good to listen to.	0

This is one of my favorites. I'm on my third bottle and will continue to wear this as long as it's being sold.	1
This book is, I believe, a necessary primer for discussion of Baptism. It provokes thought and enlightens.	1
Like every business book, it has at least 100 pages more than what would have been necessary to get the idea.	1
My brother wanted this CD---good tunes from an artist from awhile back. Tunes we don't hear too much anymore. Enjoy it.	1
This is a nice hat, if looks great and goes with any outfit.It is adjustable so it will be the perfect fit for you.	1

I love the mix of practical advice, humor, and knitting philosophy. You'll read it over and over.	1
This is really great for older folks who just need the bigger font. My parents were very pleased with this.	1
These are cute, unique toys, but I was surprised to see how small they are, very disappointed in the size.	0
The soundtrack had Lakota on it which is the only part of the movie I liked outside of the nudity.	0
Great cinematographyWeak repressed charactersI turned it off to take a piss which was far more pleasing.	0
I returned the book after looking it over, you have to eat only certain kinds of eggs. A very complicated diet.	0

weak and pointless says it all! Only rented for a Trivia event. what a waste of time. could never recommend it.	0
Comeon its Napoleon Dynamite. The price of this DVD is justified by all the great quotes or the dancing at the end if nothing else.	1
This was one of the most funniest movie I have ever seen. I went and saw it 7 Times in the Cine.	1
Truly for dummies, but not for users. I am very disappointed in this, and sorry I purchased it.	0

This is a great product, especially for those with sensitive or particular skin. My wife has been using this for years	1
I wish that other review had been here before I ordered this for Christmas. Full of holes.	0
I used this for my German classes. It's a very entertaining historical fiction account of the Hitler Youth in 1939.	1
Very surdy. The kids can actually use them. They love gardening every day. Two kids use them and they are still in great shape.	1
I got this product, it worked ok but within 30 days it broke. I dont recommend this product!!!	0

Whitney Design Cotton Canvas Blanket Storage Bag. Wanted to use it for sweaters but it has no structure.	0
I have used this product quite a bit. It IS cumbersome and it IS expensive... This is an innescessary, wasteful product.	0
Bought it, now never use it. Refills are too much of a pain and it stank up the room whenever we opened it.	0
THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH THE $10 SAVE YOUR MONEY. JASMINE GUY TRIES BUT HER JAMAICAN ACCENT IS HORRIBLE	0
Came in the mail quickly and does what it is supposed to do. No problems with it. Shares the music for two!	1

My husband is an Inuyasha fan from the Cartoon Network series. He really enjoyed the movie and I did too.	1
I haven't finished it yet but am anxious to get back to it . A very good book. no clue as to who done it.	1
I was disappointed. They are cheap and look trashy instead of rocker chic. They also run very narrow.	0
The book promises a lot, but is really just a Company Town Murder Mystery with a sci-fi setting.	0
I thought this book was pretty good but the end was a let down. In my opinion, the movie was better.	1
Ordered on February 14 and the gift recipient had it by March 11. Pretty fast for a new magazine subscription.	1
Not the best. It's pretty funny but not necessarily a ""movie"" per se. More like a few episodes without commercials.	1
I thoroughly enjoyed Blue Harvest, it's a tasteful and humorous Star Wars spoof that I watched over and over again!	1
Too vulgar!!! I disagree completely with the hero having sex with all kinds of women. Sorry but not for me.	0
Although the plot was a bit thin , the acting was top notch , and the flying scenes were great.	1
If you loved this movie, please, for the love of all that is holy, keep it to yourself.	0
First time I used it it bent and wouldn't open the bottle to make it easy open! Not worth a dime!	0
Been using this cord for several weeks with no problems. I would recommend this item and I'd buy it again if I needed one.	1

Pros - While it worked it worked wellCons - It worked for only three months	0
I'm funnier already! Don't let the easy read fool you.... this book is packed with real world ideas you can use right away.	1
A lot of action and stuff going BOOM. And just desserts were served to all those who had it comming to them.	1
This was a gift for the wife and has held up well to the use and abuse she has put it through.	1
From the beginning where the belt buckle is obviously sawed almost in half the movie just goes down hill.	0
one of the most unusual and interesting films i've seen in a long time. all of the acting is great.	1
Very full of unwanted info. difficult to navigate, still have not completely calibrated my television.	0
No instructions on what to do except for pointing you to a website. Don't take this even if you get it for free.	0
The product came in good condition and in good time. The Mattress cover is well made and was as described.	1
Boka er immari bra, jeg digga'n rtt!!! Litt tung, nesten en halv kilo. ss var'n p engelsk, men det er vel greitt nk.	1
There is nothing much i can say but amazing album. Try it and i'm sure it worths every single dime you pay for it!	1
The movie was good but the streaming was horrible. I have a cable connection and the movie repeatatly kept stopping.	0
Great movie for the whole family! My 10yr. old son watched this movie with me and we really liked it.	1
I loved this movie, but it was a bit sad. However, it makes you appreciate the people around you more.	1
I don't know why this album isn't more well-known, it certainly deserves better praise	1

Movie itself was almost OK but streaming was terrible. It kept stopping and stating from the beginning. Download it if you can first	0

This movie was boring and felt long. My husband liked it more but I spent the time surfing the web.	0
Quirky and romantic in a very clean, non-sexual, way. It almost (but only almost) made me miss being a tween.	1

Hopefully this product works when the SHTF. There aren't any instructions. What you see in the pic is what you get.	0
Way overpriced considering it is only 15 mins long and not 40 as advertised. It's not even very interesting either.	0

With so many people out of work - and I am one of them - there is no way people can afford $350 for a boxed set!!	0

This is a great show! I have watched every episode and am an instant fan! Cannot wait for next season to begin!	1
Quirky enough to be entertaining with interesting plot line while keeping the soap drama to a minimum. Fun and Cheesy, yum.	1
Am a sci fi fan. Intrigueing concept. I have enjoyed other productions more. Good to pass time while waiting for other activities.	1
I started watching it on a fluke and can't stop. I love the storyline and Noah Wyle is better than ever.	1

In essence: it may be the best product in the world, however, it won't work between a Mac-mini and a HP tower.	0
I really like my new jeans. The price was great and they fit very well. This brand of jeans has been a delight to ware.	1

Some of the most skillful character development in a modern novel. It is absolutely terrific.	1

It was really a good product, more than of what I'm expecting. Looks very elegant. It's a perfect design for my Palm.	1

Warm sexy scent. I bought it as a gift and my friend really liked it too. Great product at a good price.	1
The premise is ridiculous actually. But I couldn't put this one down! I really enjoyed it.	1
Written like the author EXPECTS this to be picked up for the movies, but still entertaining and different. sorta	1
Can't put it down, a real page-turner...full of suspense, but a little lacking in substance	1
Stephen King????? I don't think so! This is a mindless piece of trash. Don't waste your money!	0

Good package. It came as expected, and on time. Keep it up.I have run out of words for this review.	1
Very interesting, but very paranoid. More of a 'what if' scenerio than actual basis. Designed to scare and not prepare.	0

The package is broken and Iooks bad, i don't want to eat it anymore and have to throw it away.don't waste your money on it.	0
as described, looks very nice on my truck, cheaper than i could buy at the local store, took about 5 minutes to install.	1
The on/off switch felt cheap from day 1, 3 months later & it's messed up, hope I can find the receipt!	0
Won't even heat right out of the package. If it worked the price was right, now I'm not sure it's even worth returning.	0
It was a bad film, and it bored me to tears. I doubt I'll watch it again. There were a few good scenes, but nothing I remember.	0
The movie is hilarious and the cast is awesome. Probably one of John Cusacks best movies.	1
The watch is very attractive, very modern but looks retro. It looks like an very expensive watch, great value for the money.	1
metroid: zero mission was a very fun game from nintendo. and i can see there was alot of effort put in this game.	1
This is a comfortable shirt, I used it as an undershirt for by BF - he said it was nice and comfy. Shipping pretty good.	1
The material is very thin. It is not nearly as good a quality as it used to be. I wouldn't buy anymore.	0
Unfortunately, this product broke the first time I put it on my phone, so I was not able to use it.	0
Good basic firm pillow. Not ""extra"" firm, but firm. Too much trouble to return.	0
The step works fine, I just wish it was a little bit wider like the one I had before.	1
It looks like the Darwin Award was created specifically for this idiot. Good riddance to bad rubbish.	0
Stories were rather boring, though I learned a bit more about gypsies.Would not recommend.	0
I heard this song on Music Choice and it's good!!! It's like dance and jazz combine together.	1
A Very Good book from a Very Good, life saving, Therapist! Thanks for the signed copy.	1
Would be a better product, if it can be turned off, instead of pulling the USB connection from it's power source.	0
This product is much smaller than the description and image indicates. 5 of them together do not weigh a full pound.	0
I love Terry Pratchett - witty, silly, with a dash of serious. Its a nice break from reality for a while.	1
Sorry but it did not workout, as our cat would not let it be. He bite into it and within 4 weeks it was gone.	0
The paddles arrived as expected and work fine. They have a non slip grip and are comfortable on the feet.	1
II like the product because I use it for some time, YOU ARE IN SPAIN AND HAS GOOD PRICE AND SERVICE IS VERY FAST	1
This is definitely capable of pressing oranges as well as smaller citrus. I am glad to have it.	1
I loved these pillows when I first received them, but as time passes, they are loosing feathers left and right.	0

The machete and the mask are cool, but I thought the mask was gonna be more like a real mask but still a nice costume.	1
Good outdoor pics. Terrible, grainy indoor pics. Not a camera to buy if you take lots of indoor pics.	0
it was exactly as the seller said it would be, book was in great condition, received in an excellent timely manner	1
Great book, highly recommend it to anyone. Rob Bell is a genius who writes in a way that everyone can understand	1
Too much effort for the results. I don't use it any more. Much simpler (free) ways to get the same results.	0
This movie was not what I expected. Difficult to follow and far to much wasted film time on the protestors....	0

I enjoyed _A Rush of Blood to Your Head_, but was disappointed by this new album. Unpoetic lyrics set to random tunes.	0

The book is written in a 'stream of consciousness' style and was not compelling like ""The Secret Life of Bees"".	0
Satisfied. Picture quality acceptable for camera price. A little difficult to use due to too many features.	1
This book is very realistic. It doesn't use exotic ingredients or extraordinary efforts, but the results are excellent.	1
Poor examples with lots of esoteric references. There are a lot better books out there - e.g. Exploring Java from O'Reilly	0
The movie was good until the last 5 minutes. It had an intesting twist, but the worst ending ever!	0

December Boys is a movie about the bonds of friendship, and what genuinely makes a family.Maureen	1
It is a simple product! Nothing especial, but works really well.It was really what I wanted. I recommend it.	1
Cheap. Won't hold a charge for long and can't run off the cord alone. Attachments always popping off when you don't want them to.	0

I used both the Octonal and this Lurex3. The Lurex3 works far better in Coconut Grove, Florida.	1
This CD is only music, no lyrics. Makes it kinda hard to enjoy the songs from the movie with my child.	0
Does not work with tinted windows. The fan is sub par and does not have enough power to cool the car.	0
I llike the skillets very much, would have liked a third one at 12 -14 inches......	1
My three year old grandaughter loves Maya and Miguel and their funny antics. She watches them over and over again.	1
Have used this product for a while and works great. Makes my make-up go on smooth... Great for the price	1
I bought this for my son in law. He loves the large size and easy storage that it has. Great gift.	1
Saw this movie when I was a kid. It was much better when I was 13. Sooo glad I decided to rent it before buying.	0
My grandson loved the bird almost as much as I did. Very well made with a great sound. Well pleased.	1
Once I started to read I couldn't stop. Wonderful story, well written and funny.	1
Not as good as you may have heard. A couple of good tracks, but save the cash by the new Daft Punk.	0
Absurd plot. Unbelievable dialogue. Stereotypical characters. My 9-year old writes better fiction.	0
Good desk lamp, uses only 13 watts. The head swivels around. Has on/off switch on the base.	1
Best hand saw available, very sharp, fits in pocket, Blade folds up to protect you and the blade. Fast Service.	1
Make sure to get at least 1 size smaller than your actual shoe size. Other than that these are beautiful shoes.	1
Good sound quality, great features. I especially like the address book in the handset--easy to enter and use.	1
Seems to be a quality rebuild at a great price. This is my second item from these guys, no problems.	1
I found this product easy to use and of great quality when I copied my TV show to dvd. I want another one for another room/tv.	1
It does a great job. And most likely you will not find a cheaper deal.	1
This is a great film, but do yourself a favor and buy the DVD version of this - the content and quality is superior.	0
Acting is poor.... very very unrealistic even for Syfy... is not worth the cost of renting.. do not promote this	0
my favourite set alongside the scooby doo show. nice artwork on disks much better than the uk version	1
This product works ok, not great. I had mine for a few months before it broke. Can't really reccommend it at all.	0
Don't buy it. Doesn't work. It is a waste of money. If you want to waste ur money, go for it.	0
not that great to be honest. it works just as well as any other filter ive had, but possibly just a pinch better. not worth the money	0
awful.just awful.really, really awful.I love horror, and this was a complete waste of money.boo boo boo	0
I have always used Wahl beard/mustache trimmers in the past. This one would be fine if it held a charge.	0
The trimmer works. It has awkward attachments, and it loud. But its better than the Norelco flimsy trimmers.	1
I would give this less if I could. I don't know what people see in this group. Woo Hoo is enough to drive anyone insane.	0
THE COLEMAM TENT LIGHTS WERE THE BEST THING I GOT FOR THE KIDS TENTS! THEY LOVE THEM!	1
We love it and can't wait for you to stock them so we can order more. Most comfortable pool float we've had.	1
A handy thing to have if you like to eat in front of the TV, as I do. Light weight and made of good quality.	1
I got this DVD set for my boyfriend and he loves it! He says the movies look clean and the price was awesome.	1
Fun to play, but my 10 year old beat it in 4 hours total play time. Hardly worth the money.	0
This movie was Johnny's best yet. I think its great for the entire family. I would recommend to anybody young and old.	1
I would not be able to wear this, it's very smallish, but it fits my daughter perfectly!!She loves it!!	1
All my granddaughters have loved the Nate the Great books. They can read them when the first start school.	1

This filter does not fit the newer style (B5) Passats, I beleive this is for the older model ending mid 2001.	0
Radio only gets one station and only sporadically. Very sensitive. Registers more steps than you actually take.	0
I was disappointed in this product. It does not work properly. Try to use it and it will fold up	0
as always great product low dust easy on rotors I have used hawk pads on my cars for years.	1
Came quickly and seems to be great quality. Couldn't be happier with it. Although I do not have any other products to compare with.	1
I wanted this CD becuase I have a dance to one of the songs but when I heard the other songs on the cd I fell in love!	1
Fit good made to last come down past knee just the way I wanted. They run a little big but that's more comfortable.	1
My husband loved this book and we have purchased it for all our expectant father friends.	1
Excellent product. Works great on short hair lab. Removes loose hair in a jiff an is easy to clean when done.	1
A very good cd whith the best of Astor Piazzolla. Easy to know a good player and compositor. Very good music	1
poor Oksana, she lives on the edge of being famous and i just heard the hubby is going to finalized the assets.	0
This flimsy film bubbles up and makes the screen fuzzy. Stay away and don't waste your money.	0
I really thought this book would be a little more helpful but it is vague and not very detailed.	0
Bought for my little brother and he LOVES it... So, good gift for brothers, friends or anyone who would enjoy it	1
Works well overall, but still pretty slow and I'm using it with a G5 where it's supposed to be speed optimized.	1
Um....a ""bad"" twin and a ""good"" twin, now where have I seen that story before?	0
This was a poor version of a self help book, written by a novicejust trying to make a buck at someone else's expense.	0
Deja vu all over again with this rehash of NLP techniques. Disappointing as it was recommended highly by a colleague.	0
Not as original as I thought it would be, still sounds like Garth, but the thinner look is nice.	0
i love country, and I love rock and roll, but this takes on the worst parts of both. bye bye.	0
I loved this album, Phil's music is unique and very soothing, great worship album with contemporary music.	1
It is difficult to make out what it is and it fell over in the middle of wedding vows even after tryin to prop it really well.	0
We bought this for our board meetings and the wine opener broke after 2 uses. Very disappointed in this product.	0
this movie is expencive and doesn't play in the xbox 360 hd-dvd add-on even with all the updates	0
So, EVERY other HD-DVD I've put in my XBOX 360 HD-DVD player works and this one DOESN'T. Therefore, I can't review it.	0
I like this movie, specially the actor Sean Connery. I collect most of his movies. Specially the James Bond series.	1
The picture quality is really terrible. Buying this DVD is just a waste of money.	0
Don't even mind getting this... You'll regret as much as I am. I'd give it zero stars if I could.	0
These socks are wonderful! Soft, stretchy, comfortable - and they're just as great after they've been washed. Enjoy!!	1

A+! A must read for any pet owner! Gives a good picture of what the animal rights movement is all about!	1
This project is not stiff enough to do its job properly. Even for such small items as fried eggs it did not work well.	0
Great movie! It kept you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.	1
Avoid buying this one...it contains but one simple concept but drags on, and on, with no particular place to go.	0
The book held my interest for parts but I did not walk away with any new knowledge.	0
bad game woudnt work right at all and it gave the phone big problems big time so sorry not good	0
A good read. I am a fan of Jeffrey Archer's books. He always delivers an excellent and engaging story line that is singularly his.	1
I bought two of these for my wife. They always work great but they don't last -- which is why I bought two.	1
Watch out! The mute on this still allows some sound to get through. That can be a big problem.	0
I have yet to get even one copy of the magazine unfortunately that was ordered well over a month ago	0

I used it on a 55 pound Australian Shepherd and it fit great. I think is sizes a bit small but great quality for the price	1
This is a very handy to have product. The nasal aspirator(snotsucker) is surprisingly good. A must have for every mother!	1
Not dependable-caused my computer to have major issues. I suggest you get a Microsoft or Linksys one.	0
Fun for the whole family, my kids (6 and 8) loved it as well. An oldie but a goodie, I recommend it.	1
Not very bright but small enough to put in the pocket so we can have it with us at any time.	1

Love this book, have read it many times in various forms. The pictures are lovely, and easy to read in modern English	1

I was really looking forward to this book because part 1 was so good but this book was a bore and very disappointing.	0
Works just fine in my imac g5 ppc (non intel). Install was super easy, 2gig ram makes the machine a little more stable.	1
The memory works great, as expected. It was deliverd to me in a timely manner without any problems.	1
It was a very easy upgrade and my computer is working so much faster. Well worth the low cost of the memory.	1
Ordered and arrived as expected, installed straight away and has worked without a hitch since. Top notch	1
Pretty good from a scene that's probably better than america. great beats and macho rhymes.	1
This CD sucks.The Thrills have got only pretty faces and cool clothes.Their music's just not my type.	0
my husband is happy with his new shaver as it is light weight shaves close and is very portable.	1
This is difficult to use, you need 3 hands and it shoots out so fast, would not buy again	0
suspenseful intrigue if you like woody harrelson, then it is tolerably good, kate mara is for the birds in this one	1
Cute shirt. I bought this for my granddaughter because I always sing ""You Are My Sunshine"" to her.	1
Poorly printed with overly large text and amateurish illustrations.Basically it's not worth the paper it's printed on.Meh!:P	0
It sounds so nice .i recommend u to get one if u like ur motorcycle nice and loud so people can hear u. looks good	1
Item does not fit correctly..must go over a crome molding and it does no do so...thus not able to glue it down.	0
I would recommend you buy this disc, for the Mt. Zion Medley alone. It's a fun mix, especially Crocus Bag...	1
I wish I would have read the above review before wasting my time with this book.... going now to get my money back	0
The music is great but sound quality is terrible. A new remastered CD is urgently needed!	0
THIS SONG IS DA BOMB AND WHOEVER DOES NOT LIKE THIS SONG NEEDS TO BE PUT IN THE ROOM W/ THE PADDED WALLS!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
I love it and the fact that it comes with a case for the tablets. It was easy to place into my cats mouth.	1
This is a really good album, well worth checking out. A good mixture of soul influenced rock.	1

This product came just as it should. Brand new and still wrapped. Great Seller will use again.	1
Nice try New Line, I think you know where to shove these theatrical version blu-rays.Pathetic.	0
Fool Me Twice Shame on Me...I will wait till all three extended versions are available.	0
Sorry New Line,you won't be getting any of my money until the extended versions are released.	0
I made the mistake the first time around on DVD. I won both editions. I am not doing the same with Blu-ray. Nice try sharks.	0
At what point is enough ,enough??? Does this industry really think it's loyal customers are just fodder?	0
Don't buy the theatrical version. New Line is just trying to squeeze every possible penny out of our pockets.	0
See title. Avoid the quadruple-dip -- don't buy LotR BDs until the extended versions are released.	0
I need to watch 12+ hours of high-def material on bluray or else my head will explode. Really.	0
Why are they doing it again...just put both versions in one big package and let us have it.	0
I agree with most reviews. The choice is very simple: extended or nothing. Cristal clear. Period.	0
Could have done EE with seamless branching, but instead want to 'force' fans to double dip.	0
Why not release the ENTIRE versions? There's no excuse for these abbreviated versions other than greed.	0
I will not be buying this version I will wait for the extended version to be released.	0
Wow, I was so excited for the extended edition on bluray. Bummer. This is only the theatrical edition.	0
This product needs no review. The title speaks for itself. One Trilogy to Rule them all.	1
This is disheartening. Hopefully they won't drag out the second release because there is no way I'd buy this.	0
The Blu-Ray release should contain the extended version of the movie. Don't buy this version!!!	0
Just another way of the film industry ripping off the consumer. DON'T BUY IT. WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED RELEASE.	0
GREED GREED GREED. Don't buy this. The extended versions are coming soon and that's what we all really want.	0
What is this??? No extended version in BD. I'll be patient and wait for them to release the ex version	0
I already own original version and extended version and would buy Blu-ray EXTENDED VERSION.....not both.	0
Better wait for the Extended Version... If you got the Extended DVD version, stick with it...	0
Please everyone...don't buy this...be wise and wait for the extended versions. They are baiting us to double-dip.	0
It may be a clone or the real deal. Point is it works, The ""M"" doesn't light up, just a small dot. Worth the price.	1
Buy it. It's the best hatchet I've owned. Sharp as a razor and light as a feather. Strong, durable.	1
Not what I thought it was going to be. Several songs that weren't their best. The sound system wasn't too good either.	0
I loved this book!! It has imagination danger and tons ofaction!!!! Read this Book!	1
It looks ok when you initially put it on, then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull (not much length or volume).	0
Has no external speaker jacks, if you have built in speakers in several rooms, this will not power them so buy another system.	0
I bought this as a gift and did not want to part with it. However, I will most likely purchase more in the future.	1
Best way yet to keep red wine off of the tablecloth! Quality-made and durable, you'll love it.	1
I finally got a chance to watch this DVD and it did not work! TOTALLY bummbed!!! It is an honest mistake I'm sure.	0
There is song in this DVD that the verbs are not congigated correctly!!!! And the accents are BAD!!!!	0
Had it for almost two years with almost daily use. Still puts a nice edge on my global and my other cheap knives as well.	1
This is such a great show. There is not one bad episode in the series and Dan Schneider is a TV genius. Highly recommended.	1
This is a great book. I have just started reading it and am really enjoying it. Would definitely recommend to anyone.	1
I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time!	0
This book was better than I expected for one that has been written so long ago. Great theory never goes out of fashion.	1
you wouldn't know it was supposed to be funny.Tired, recycled cliche's jokes and characters abound.	0
Interesting and sexy. This movie would never win an oscar but it was well filmed and the acting was better than I expected.	1
Very soothing. Just what you need to put you or baby to sleep. Peaceful. Relaxing. Beautiful instrumentals.	1
This is a wonderful book and very useful to anyone learning spanish or english.	1
If you don't care about design and lack of rings choices this is an excellent product for you.	1
I can lock my bicycle or other things up good with this lock. I have no problems with it so far.	1
If you like Trey Anastasio, Les Claypool, and Stewart Copeland; you can't go wrong buying this album!	1
nothing about this dress is good, NOTHING. its puffy and looks nothing like the silhouette in the photo.	0

These seaweed strips are disgusting. I can't get the nasty flavor out of my mouth. I totally regret purchasing them.	0

Didn't even reboot my T61p, just ejected the optical drive and slid this in with a 500GB SATA. Just worked.	1
This is a piece of junk, low budget movie. Do not waste your time and money its not worth, reviewing it.	0
The Intensity doesn't deserve to be a NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER. The plot is NOT intense at all though it has a surprising ending.	0
This is the first Dean Koontz book that I read. This book made me an instant fan. Love every min. of it!	1
Both pairs are already falling apart on me... boxers I've had for years are in better shape than this.	0
5 star video and sound along with top notch action sci fi flick. This has made a fine addition to collection.	1
Buy.com has Amazon beat on the price of this. $19.99 vs. $22.49, this doesn't happen often!	1
I didn't know there were different series I got a DVD that was released in another country and it won't play	0
This is simply one of the best TV series ever made, and BBC has made lots of them. It is classy, sophisticated and hilarious.	1
This adapter is very easy to install and works great. Much fast transmission and distance than my Netgear adapter.	1
Este equipo me lo solicitó mi esposa. Ella está fascinada con este equipo tanto es que lo está recomendando. Saludos	1
Machine locked up after less than 30 days of use. You get what you pay for. Had to have it repaired.	0
leg locks broke on first use. Nothing more to add except if I could give a minus rating I would.	0
The music of this album is one of many that's from Britney, adding with unique design, that I like.	1

Do not waste your money on this! It is the worst CD for babies that I have ever heard!	0
*spoiler alert*This movie was really awesome, but I have to say, the pigs were a little hard to believe. Seriously.	1
A GOOD STRONG CD A WISER AND OLDER DEF LEPPARD JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER!	1
This cd is great from a band that knows how to rock. They mix it up with slow ones and rockers.	1

Luckly a friend loaned me this book, so I didn't have to pay good money for trash paper!!!!	0
Unable to return due to lousy return policy. But relaxed means huge which seems to be a trend with Americans	0
Good color, good fit. True to pictures. Good length - that is important for tall guy.Good price, as well.	1

The slow songs are dreadful and indulgent. I wish people knew about the Gun Club.	0
I was disgusted with the teen sex and language. The story content was NC17 rated. I threw the series away after the first episode.	0
I love this show; it is hilarious! Put the kids to bed before you watch it, a lot of f-bombs dropped.	1
I read about 37% of the book and it became so confusing and hard to follow as it goes in so many directions.	0
I've only read one or two L.J smith books but i recently bought the first of this trilogy at a Walden Books in west palm beach	1
It is a god show ,but there are others in this series I like better. Lexx rocks,if you like strange scifi shows try Lexx.	1
A fine album of late 1980's funk/dance music done gracfully by the diva Grace Jones.	1

Method Man can sum up my review in three words: Doodoo is doodoo. People, this ""book"" is certainly doodoo.	0

This album is too sugary. It is not authentic. It is like the orchestra repressed his soul and truth meaning of the songs.	0
I guess I should have spent a little more time researching clips. I suppose it is functional, just inexpensive and flimsy.	0
Didn't finish it--hard to follow and was never convinced I would care when I finally figured out what the story was about.	0

This is one of the most awesome albums I have come across in many years. I can listen to this over and over.	1
I have given this book one star ...but not as a kids book, it's more like a cartoon porn book for sick adults	0
The watch was nice to look at, but the winder broke off within 4 days. I ended up throwing the watch out.	0
Apparently they work for some people but not others. Too bad I had to pay $20 to find out they do nothing for me.	0

This CD is Beautiful and a joy to listen through from the first track to the last. The sound is very full and natural.	1

You absolutely need this for crank bolt removal on 96-00 civics.... a long breaker bar to hold it as well.	1
Slash has such a horrible sound, and such a generic style. Makes one think of Vanilla Ice playing metal...	0
Slash has such a horrible sound. It makes one think of Jeff Beck killing his cat.	0
Sure - I'm going to buy this without any description, starring roles, or movie titles. NOT!!	0

I thought the film was very entertaining, the plot was okay but the dry humor of the alien was the best.	1
It was purchased and sent to the UK (it didn't work in that country) The DVD was as described andreceived in a timely manor	0

The first volume of Styx's ""Greatest Hits"" was bad enough, but these are the rejects. You can just imagine how horrid they are!	0
Its a case not much else to say besides it fits well and seems well made. I have two of them.	1
This case is much too big for the unit-but my fault obviously did not check the dems-so now it sits in a drawer	0
This is the best case for my external hard drive. It is much easier to travel than in the past.	1
Works great, better than some that I have gotten with mp3 players. Works with other stuff too. happy customer. ty	1
There's no Nordic Noir in the gem of a movie. It's a whole new genre in and of itself. Beautiful.	1

Great background music for a hard day's work. Keeps the energy up, the idle time down, and the mood steady.	1

A very shallow book trying to cover too many years and subjects with so little number of pages.	0
I made a male version of this costume from the 1974 EK jumpsuit and bought this one to match. We won 3rd place!!!	1
Paper is thin and cheap and the print is tiny. My head ached big time when I tried reading the first book.	0
No one writes like J.R.R. Tolkien, and the newer edits are better than the 80's. Great set to keep for the family.	1
Perhaps my fault but this wasnt the actualy book set. Seems like some type of tv/radio version of the storyline.	0
vaak heel grappige anekdotes in welbekende Brouwersiaanse stijl. Naar mijn mening het beste deel uit de feuilletonreeks.	1
not very tall, good for elevating, looks nice and not bulky or bad, fits in good with a nice laptop.	1
A book all about our ABSOLUTELY FAVORITE CELEBRITIES that lets us feel morally superior! I can't wait for the movie!	0

The name says it all...don't let the pictures above of ""happy endings"" fool you. the massager isn't THAT good....	0
The ear phones are very bad. The voice is not clear getting noise. Not worthy to buy this product.	0
Got this fourth season on time and in its original packaging as I had anticipated. I'm watching season 7 right now!	1
While this is based on a great concept, I felt that it took too long to build up suspense and was not really that frightening.	0
I'm sorry, but you still can't beat good old Revere cookware. It's getting harder to find but the search is worth it.	1
Hooked it up with no problem. But at full power it is weak at most. If you want really good bass then buy the more expensive one.	0
Looks good sounds good what more can I say I'll be the back bone of the Ceiling spaekers above with a new amp.	1

THIS RING WAS TARNISHED WHEN I RECEIVED IT. IT ALSO STARTED TO TURN GREEN. DO NOT GET	0
I really could not review this product due to opening it and when I went to install in printer, I realized I got the wrong toner.	0
Gets the job done, but does not leave much of a semi-gloss. Would definitely go with high gloss, but it is a good product.	1
The concept is great, but once the shirt is washed (& instructions were followed) it was ruined.	0

It worked for about 10 minutes then stopped working. Don't buy unless you want to be disappointed.	0

It's almost made out of balsa wood, but if the color suits you it's a cheap way to hold stuff.	1
We use this to store Organic Whole Grains for use in our flour mill. It keeps the grains well, and keeps out unwanted moisture.	1

This tape will do the job just like any other, but Scotch tape is the best. I recommend this product.	0

This book seems even more repetitive than some of the others in this series. Still cute though.	1
I was not pleased at all with my purchase. The idea was suppose to be in excellent condition, but the last page was riped out.	0
Great for deburring holes and such, Lost 1 star for not having a place to store extra hardware within the handle	1

These dowel center plugs work as indicated - simple yet effective. Shipped and received in a timely manner.	1

It's half way through 2012 and still no falcon crest season 3. I could be dead before I see this wonderful series again	1
It gave the dinosaurs a mind and a story. It was humorus at times. It was intertaining. The animation was well done.	1
This show never fails to make me laugh! Always can identify with the 90's reference quips! We Absolutely LOVE it!!!	1
If you have the rest of the series, you won't want to miss out on this one. I can't wait for the next season to come out on DVD.	1
Scanner was very easy to install and use for the first time. I am very pleased with it.	1
If I lose power, I can still cook! I gave one to my sister, too and they like it, too!	1
Movie was slow and hard to watch. Not very satisfying. Would have made a better TV show than a full length movie.	0
Within 15 minutes I was dozing...looked over and my husband was asleep as well. Very boring - turned it off.	0
If you are a fan of the show you won't be disapointed.....just get it! Cant wait for the new season to start! #teampinkman	1
I was reluctant to begin this series but I watched the first four seasons on Netflix and was hooked after episode 1.	1
I love this TV show the reason I gave it a bad review is to try and get amazon prime to put subtitles on their programming.	0
What a boring season I'm so disappoints .there was no point . Was there always only 8 episodes .hope better next year	0
Another incredibale episode of this wonderful series. If you love Breaking Bad, you will love how Walt enjoys his birthday!	1
Disappointing. Slow moving and boring. I am Hoping the the next episode is better. Always love Aaron Paul though. Thumbs down.	0
This is the best Breaking Bad season yet! I just wish they didn't break it up into two halves. It seems kind of mean.	1
My husband and I love this show! I am a little disappointed with how dark Walt has gone!! I can't wait to see what happens!	1
This show has it all. Great characters. Talented actors. Drama, suspense, humor and a plot like no other on TV	1
It was hard for me to find the 8 packs of cartridges in stores, so I was pleased. This item arrived very fast!	1
The book is great. It was what I expected and it came so soon after ordering.	1

Cons: Buttons Too small, not very responsive, not enough direct function buttons.Pros: It does work	0
All I want to say is I love this book. I will read it again and again. I also plan on buying copies for friends	1
Great Book. Would definitely rise those in sleep but surely not those is Coma (Hindus).	1
This movie would appeal to some teenage girls, that is about all I can say. I have seen much better.	0
Not a good product. I bought AC adapter for my dell inspiron 5100 and it was listed as new but i got a refurbished one.	0

Product was as ordered, but did not power the laptop. Total waste of money. Not worth returning.	0
My First Amazing World Explorer 2.0 does not work on Windows XP even though the advertisement on Amazon says it does.	0

Very happy with my purchase. Continue to look at Amazon products and I am sure will make more purchases in the future.	1
Never received the book!! Wrote to the seller 3 times with no response. Wrote to Amazon 2 times no response!	0

Camera is nice and take good pics. But never install the software. It doesn't work and screws up your computer...	0
The more I read these books the more it makes sense. Incredibly interesting and opens so many doors. Loved it	1
Always believed there was somewhere we went when we left here but before Heaven. This just proves it! Great book!	1
Not the best. Dvd quality is not great. I own allot of the 10 min solutions. Not impressed with this one.	0
Incredibly dull ""hard SF"" novel reads more like a soap opera set in the nail-bitingly-intense world of academia. Skip it.	0
I enjoyed it very much. I may buy more Fat Albert's Collection.	1
This was an exciting season. I loved it and couldn't wait to buy more!Amazon has everything I want!	1

Product arrived on time and seems to help my tennis elbow situation although it has not cured it.	1
They got the specs wrong, it is way too small (and now I have to return it).	0

Alot of creative details and laughter. You can relate to all the characters in the movie. It is fun for kids.	1
This magazine does not fit the well R7. Either that or i got the wrong magazine. Anyway, dont buy this magazine.	0

Gets really boring at times. Jumps all over the place and keeps on repeating......... But otherwise informative.	0
I saw this tiny jewel box for $4.99 at Home Goods. The idea that they want $17 for it is , wow, for something so small.	0
Mediocre presentation at best. A DVD titled A History of the Electric Guitar should contain some timeline of history.	0
I love this product, it helps relax my muscles and also warms me up if it's cold! Definitely a great purchase.	1
Kikkerland Will Return Wall Clock:its already a month so far so good, Great small funny wachi liked it very much	1

I just love Stephanie's music and this album is a total joy to listen to! Recommending to everyone, everywhere! :-)	1
There was a time when I owned and studied every single book on candle magic. What a waste of time that was...	0
Be sure to view the larger image. I thought this was another David Bowie CD.	0
Better reading second time. Great action and the science is plausible if overly simplified. Keep me up late finishing the book.	1
We have the books and now the dvd. My son loves the adventure and I'm glad that I bought this. Just what I expected.	1
good where delivered quickly but CDs where not clear at the end,,(both disc 1 and 2 scratch)	0
Not a good book at all. Heavy-handed, obvious. If you want to read a real satirical writer, try Vonnegut or Swift or Twain.	0
The last review was bad. This is a very good card if use properly in a spell-caster based deck	1
The book wasn't in as good of a condition as I expected, but I was glad it wasn't previously written in.	1
My all time favorite show. I would buy all seasons if available. I hope it is released soon.	1
GREAT TOOL. CAUTION THOUGH. IT DOES NOT COME WITH A CHUCK. CHUCK SELECTION SHOULD BE MADE WITH TECH OR SALES HELP.	1
I'm not even going to explain how bad this movie is. I've seen worse but it's bad, really bad.	0
This should go straight to the garbage. They should have a rating of ""0"" for this piece of junk.	0
These are bright, colorful and very fun to put up and decorate a room with without being too permanent!	1
Author story of witch dance was slow and very boring. Plot sim to be made up as she went. Same old thing, poor on description.	0
These work but due to a weak soldering job the ring on the lid came off 5 seconds after we took them out of the box.	0
Looks like some nutjob's prison scrawls from when he was doing time for domestic terrorism. Just a total waste of money.	0

This gun sucks completly, dirrections sucked!i couldnt get it together, then i did, and broke in 20 shots! buy a better gun.	0

I can't use it on my computer, I didn't realize that when I bought it, but I have Windows 7.	0

The capsule is easy to take and seems to help my husband with ease of movement in a damaged knee..	1
I have been reading all of the Brad Thor books in this series. Enjoyable storyline but certainly not a classic series.	1

I Love this type story, it reminds me alot of the X-files in a way with all the strange happenings.	1
Awesome show. New version of files for sure. Looking forward to watching remaining seasons. Fast paced and Sci Fi based.	1
The main character is an idiot, if you're a guy spare yourself. They tried to rip off the x-files but did an awful job.	0
This was a total rip off. The entire video lasted eight or nine minutes, making it cost about a dollar a minute before shipping cost.	0
Bottom line: When the built-in level is level, the laser line is not. Makes a great paperweight.	0

My first time to buy Wilton stuff. It leaks and it is not easy to clean. I'm gonna buy another one.	0
They should have kept this out of circulation. The live set is disjointed, lost in form. Blech......	0
This CD kicks! ""Song 2"" is great. I got the CD for ""Song 2"" but now Im into the whole album. I highly suggest this CD!	1

This was a very dumb movie, I should have listened to the other ratings but figured I would give it a try.. oh well	0
Johnny Depp never fails to amaze. He plays an awesome (and very confused at times) vampire- great for the family.	1
It couldn't figure out if it was a campy comedy like the Addams Family or a drama like the oldTV show.	0
Some subtleties you have to look for in the movie but they're classic Burton. I enjoyed the movie and recommend it.	1

This overpriced comb broke the large end tooth within days. Buy an unbreakable one instead.	0

This product was not what I thought it was and I could not use it. I would like to return the package.	0
The cables are nothing special. There good if you just want a cheap HDMI cable for your dvd player.	0
Cable did not function AT ALL. Not worth the hassle or expense to send back. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. IT DID NOT WORK!	0
I bought a bunch of these and they all work fine. I'll buy more if I need them. High quality video.	1
This is cheap and the right size the I wanted because I didn't want any long wires filling up near my television. Also great quality.	1
This cable was completely worthless! When I plugged it in, half of the screen went all static-y. I was very disappointed.	0
When I replaced two other functioning cables between a satellite box and Samsung TV with this one, I lost the signal.	0
Signal goes in and out. I recommend spending a little more to get a higher quality product. This cord was a complete waste of time.	0
I got exactly what I wanted when I purchased this six foot cable for my external HD. It was well worth the purchase.	1
Gave these to my son for Christmas to go with his VCR/DVD recorder. I can't review as I don't know if he even used them or not.	1
Great product for the price it's offered at. Used it with an Apple TV Receiver and after months of use, I have no complaints.	1
Why spend more when this cable works just fine. I have used a few of these around the house and they all work great!	1

Good price. I don't see the point in spending much on a cable that carries a digital signal.	1
I have a few HDMI cables, some more expensive and this one works works just as good. Great cable and super cheap	1
The quality is great for the price, but it is hardly 6 feet long, more like 4. Very disappointed with the length.	0
Extremely happy with this hdmi cable! Good quality, doesn't feel cheap. Best hdmi for use with anything.	1
Ordered it a month ago and still haven't gotten it and they ask me for a review. Not sure what they want me to say.	0
Cable is intermittent and will loose signal when moved at all. I would never recommend to anyone. Save your money.	0

Poor quality pictures, regreted buying it, but was cheap as salt. Guess you get what you pay for. Will rate you a (C)	0
They are great for the price I just ordered two extra ones to have on hand if need be. They seem sturdy	1
Not much to say about this accept for that it worked just fine and we had no problems with them whatsoever :)	1
I bought all my HDMI cables from here. No need to pay 10 times more when these work perfectly.	1
Best quality for the best price! This cable looks better and lasts longer than HDMI cables that are much higher priced.	1
Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised. I recommend this product to any one looking for hdmi cables	1
I totally agree with Daniel and Miguel. You learn pratically nothing with this book. You only be more confused.	0
I found this brush difficult to use and my dogs really struggled when I tried to use it.	0

deposits color. looks better when combed or rubbed through hair to avoid a creamy look. good quick touch up product.	1
We love Phil Hartman, we love this collection of some of his best skits and characters. Also love the audition segment.	1
This product was very easy to set up and use. Switching from tv and blu ray requires moving the switch from one to two.	1
I came to not like this movie because it was to corny and the plot was week. Plus the acting really sucked.	0
I am loving this series. The book was in great shape and came within the specified time.	1
Love this one. Must've bought it half-a-dozen times. Everybody wants one and they take it from me.	1
Bland ramblings. It seemed funny at the time. . .and the times have changed. Try another disc and forget this one.	0

The song No Way is extremely well done. Other than that it's off to the used CD store with this one.	0
Book came in within alotted amount of time and was in great shape. The book itself is a great read as well.	1

I got these movies for my husband, he likes them but they aren't done very well.	0
I can not stand mosquito's. This collapses the population, quiet and I'm not eaten alive like I was before I purchased it.	1
This is simply a rehash of his other books. None of them any good. His redefinition of assets and liabilities is simply absurd.	0
Not what I thought it was still sitting in the packaging husband says that he can use it for something else. So I just kept it.	0
It's like reading the web version... Except you have to pay 13 dollars for it!	0
I'm not an expert, but if it makes my friend happy then it is A-OK with me as well	0
I love these! They add color and sophistication to my kitchen. They have great color and luster. I highly recommend them.	1
This camera is great for vacations and very easy to use. Hardly had to use the book to set it up.	1
This is a great collection by Lettie Alston. The performances are clear and poignant.	1
The book is great for reading, when you're trying to past time. It also helps educate me more of whats going on around my life.	1
John Cusak at his early best! Was glad to see I could find this on DVD. Always funny and had some memorable movie quotes.	1
Seriously it took longer to put this together than it lasted after a couple of semi-rough landings!	0

The story very unexpected, boring, every time I watch the Video, it makes me sleepy all the time. :-p	0
I bought this for a Jeep I purchased. It fit's flawlessly and does what it is meant to do. I would buy this again.	1

I love scrubs. It is amazing,I cannot wait until season 6 comes out on dvd! It's such a cliff hanger!	1
It's a nice wall mount for the price that I paid for. I hang my 42 inches TV in my bedroom and save a lot of space.	1
A most interesting book by an expert knitter. The skills here do not age, the projects are timeless.	0
Very funny.Check out Dave Chappelle's Block Party. Great music and interviews.	1
Quite good, adding depth and emotion to an amazing movie. The LOTR would not be nearly as good without Howard Shore.	1
If you like a rougher scrub try this. It is a wonderful scrub and this is an excellent price.	1
i am on my 3rd copy of this excellent gothic/black metal masterpiece go on give it a try	1
We wanted it for our collection, and it's a good movie just boring in places. But at least now I can mark it off my list.	1
I really like this feeder- the only flaw is it is difficult to clean. I use a toothbrush and it works pretty well.	1
I just received my copy today from Columbia House and am looking forward to viewing it!	1
Not hot enough to warm a small Brinkmann smoker to 150 degrees, even worse when trying to heat water. Buy something else.	0

This movie was truly a fantastic feture. The pictures of the film were amazing.	1
Absolutely the most detailed and helpful research publication that I have found on this subject.	1
I would only buy it if it was on sale. It is a pretty good guitar songbook but not the best. Did it's job I suppose.	1

This is a really bad production of the movie.There is no remastering, so the movie is grainy and blurry.	0
i gave this one star because i can not believe the movie is not in the widescreen format. i do not like fullscreen.	0
We have learned much from this video. We hope to share it with our 13 year old son who has Asperger's.	1
I almost fell asleep listening to this CD. The only song worth listening was ""party with the animals"" with ozzy.	0
I am so glad to get this CD. I even love the photograph on the cover. Reminds me of my youth!	1
The cards are visually beautiful, as well as very impactful when used. I now give them as gifts.	1
Easy on, easy off and comfortable too! Can wear outside or in and a great price to ""boot."" No pun intended!	0
The beauty of decay is sometimes surreal and mysterious. A musthave for booklovers and photographers.	1
Nice book; I thought I knew the trick of the trade, but learnt some more from this book.Easy to read and to follow	1
A heartwarming christian book that i enjoyed. You will as well, if you are looking for a book about love in the 1800's.	1
as a wrestling fan and for what i paid for this it was good to watch so it was worth it	1
it's beautifully shot.. the production design was great for the budget... but the film didn't hold my attention..	0
The product came in a timely fashion and was in perfect, unused condition. I would definitely buy from this seller again.	1
The battery I received doesn't seem to me to hold the charge nearly as long as the original. Bit of a disappointment.	0
Does exactly what it's supposed to for less than half the price of radio shack. Why is that place still in business anyway?	1

but its funny as hell and a classic .....makes me want to wreck shop	1
I wish someone would write about the laws of each state. Some cemeteries will only let you clean your own family graves.	1

At least that is not very easy to do-- takes effort. So fast and balanced set up is hard.	0

The CD worked for a day or two, then when I tried to play it a few days later it wouldnt play a few of the songs.	0
it wasnt that great of a movie... but when they said twisted fun they meant it seriously very much so.	1
My wife and I watched 15 minutes of this garbage. We love horror flicks, but this one should be placed in the flop category.	0
Crappy story line.Not even scary enough for the 13 year old males it targets.A waste of energy, talent, and time.	0
Definitely a twist on the normal horror movie...If you're looking for a fun movie experience, this movie is for you.	1
Boy, what a movie, why did I get this one, I forgot!I will say this is a scary movie, I'm glad I had someone to hide behind!	1
This movie was not good at all. The whole plot was given away in the first scene. It wasnt even a scary movie	0

Sean and his like are as close to evil as America gets - somewhat ironic, wouldn't you say?	0
Meh. Like Philip k Dick, but free is free for a reason. I'll judge by the next free short to come.	0

I have a fairly large head (I wear a 7-1/2 fitted hat) and this is too large for my head. I am seriously dissatisfied.	0
I felt this book to be boring, an inferior rehash of Roth's other work. In fact, the prose is sentimental and often downright poor.	0

Having to buy a new 1GB switch because this one went dead, too far past warranty to replace.	0
This product was a waste of money. The dispenser came apart and made a mess. The sealant did not work and the ball went flat again.	0
My 1yo loves these and I like them two. They are tasty. The peach and the sweet potato ones are great	1

I was thinking that this was a different raw foodist/author. Kinda disappointing, I don't like his writing style or his approach.	0
The design of the bottle is great, but the solution is a little strong. However, it works great to clean sinuses!	1
The best book for seeing Judy's life through photos. Some new information, too. A light, enjoyable read.	1
Like the first book in the series, I read this in less than 24 hours - couldn't put it down. Another fun, fast read!	1
I think Dr Denmark is brilliant. I would recommend this book to all mothers. Her methods are tried and true.	1
the outer box is not very strong, so u can not lift this thing with handle but overall its value for money.	1
These were as advertised and are plenty good for what I use them for. They are very easy to put back into the case.	1
The inside of the case is made of a very cheap and flimsy plastic that arrived in pieces. Sent it back.	0
This hoodie was practically see through. Nothing like the one we bought a few years back. I returned it.	0

This product is very well constructed and you can't beat it for the price. It is also very easy to fold up for transport. A+++	1
I thought there is more on the dvd. This is poor...The ""Making of"" Is not a Making Of. It is just a little blabla...	0

Got this for my girl friends birthday. Did get a longer, thicker chain, one that came with it is fairly thin.	1
Its beautiful & its priced right. However either the chain should be made better or it should be made available without a chain.	1

A little slow at times, but a good read. Love the mystery that was involved and always like reading about sunken treasure.	1
Have purchased this model (8981) of tape from Amazon before. It's stronger than anything you can buy in the stores.	1
The ""Cars of the Sizzling 60s"" book I ordered was delivered on time and in exactly the advertised condition.	1
Unlike many cute baby towels, this one is not only cute, but large and very absorbent.	1
Heavy base, holds the tape, nothing special. It does the job. What more is there to say? Would buy it again.	1
It does what it is supposed to and it was reasonably priced. Just what you'd expect. I would purchase again.	1
Liquid Paper works so much better than White Out. I like when I just have to swipe the error once.	1

Toaster has delivered as promised.toasts great and gives me control to bring up any time.	1
My husband likes the rubber scalp brush, he just wishes it had a finger hole instead of the post in the middle.	1
It came in a container that kept it from getting damaged so for that I give it a high score.	1
It was an ok read. It was not at all deep, and was more or less just research regurgitation about CEOs.	0
Seriously, like dude, seriously, this box set is so sweet. Seriously. I'm pretty sure this will fulfill the word requirement.	1
The cast iron stove/grill cracked on the first use. Pour casting I guess.The meal was good but expensive!	0

If you like Downton Abbey - you will like this series too! A bit different since it takes place in London proper.	1
Caught this my chance one evening on PBS and laughed so hard I cried. His dry sense of humor has me hooked.	1

Language was horrible. Movie not as entertaining as I thought it would be. Was very disappointed.	0
The pen point shape is ridiculous, I have to carefully tilt the pen when writing. The lid is tight, in an uncomfortable way	0
There is just way too much fighting and arguing in this movie. It had such potential.	0
This movie is a blast. Kinda reminds me of a few relationships in my past, it's something to relate to. Scary but true!	1

This movie is just another in a long line of predictable scarecrow movies and ultimately - it is quite forgettable.	0

I like Kenny. His songs are good, but the videos on CMT are very racy. This CD is the only one of his I own but I really enjoy it.	1

It does what it's supposed to do for a fantastic price. The connections seem sturdy and the color makes it easy to keep track of.	1
Very handy guide for prep of the home for incidents, good for those that have properties out from major areas.	1
Works great. Does everything a typical Digital Multimeter does with even more extra built in meters for more measurements!	1
I have tryed it and it is great. The two screens it comes with are only 5"", but it is still good to use	1
There is no melody or rhythm here. It sounds like an introductory lesson in how to play steel drum.	0

If you love the show... you'll love the DVD set. Witness some of the best acting on TV from a long time.	1

Simple yet does the job it was designed to do perfectly. Especially good for those of you who don't have a block for knives.	1
Price is not worth your data and time. Spend a little bit more and you will get something MUCH better.	0
Fun to watch the grandchildren discover colors, shapes, sorting and formulas their first year of their journey.	1
this one is the best- it really cuts instead of pulling, 100% of the time!!! yea!	1
Will have to return it as it makes a lot of noise and popping sounds like it is about to fail. Am afraid to use it.	0

If you want your amp to sound like a Tascam cassette 4-track from 1993, this is the pedal for you.	0
I like it especially the display which can rotate. Very good for someone like me who travel alone.	1
excellent quality and compatitive price. Postal box too big which incurred higher postage charges.	1
it was way too small.... size large felt like a small medium. I didn't try to return it. Just not using it.	0

I'll give this album 2 stars for her looks, but the music isn't nearly as good as Ashlee Simpson's.	0
The bb gun malfunctioned the second day i had it. like the third time i shot it the whole chamber came off.	0
It only cost a penny, and yet it's still a rip off. Do yourself a favor, put the penny in a donation jar and save the shipping.	0
The mag will suck all of the bb's up if you u put more then one bb in the mag and they will get stuck in this gun!	0
After hours of attemps to assemble this, we've given up. We're taking it back and finding something else. Poor quality.	0

ok, but none of these songs are nearly as good as ordinary life on the cruel intentions soundtrack	0
These stakes are great! They are heavy duty and light weight and easy to use. Great product, I recommend them.	1

This is a wonderful lens, I compared the Canon to this one side by side and this one won hands down!!!	1
It is a mystery story. Like many mysteries, a little hard to follow at times. But it does its job and keeps you guessing.	1

The book took almost a MONTH to arrive, and my many requests for information was IGNORED!!!! Terrible Service!!!	0

This product works great. It arrived on time with nice packaging and its use is just as the description listed.	1
Stopped working after a week and the wires rip so easily. Not worth it at all. Spend a few more dollars some wheres else.	0
Very good headset for the price but if you tend to used it longer than a hr then ur ear will hurt	1
Self pitying, drunken ramblings.No genius. No insight. No fun.This is not pilosophy, not poetry.Save your money.	0
$20 for a 1-Gig card holds about 335 6-megapixel pictures. That's more than enough for me.	1
No problems, no issues, on time. The box set was nicely bound and made the perfect holiday gift for a fan.	1
IT IS OKAY BUT ONLY LASTS A YEAR OR SO. THEN YOU JUST HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER ONE. K&H OR SELLER NO HELP.	0

José José is a great artist, his voice, his feelings, and the cuality of the songs he play, is great too.	1

The item arrived shortly after purchase, great condition, what you see is what you get.	1
looks like a nice heavy piece but when it arrived it seemed light weight and cheep. I will return:(	0
So so. I didn't care for it because the music/instrumental, deviates too much from the original track.	0

Although her tremendous talent shines through these early movies, I found the subject matter pretty depressing.	0
A good product but probably could do just as well with a home cleaner such as dish soap but would recommend.	1
I wish there had been more media (unbiased) coverage of this movie, it certainly was an eye opener for us!	1
God bless the USA we are a great nation under god and no person or group can take that away.	1
IF you wonder how in the world this man has made it and what he is up to you need to see this movie.	1
totally distorts the truth. Obama was raised by his American Mother and grandparents.Africa had almost no influence on him.	0
Political propaganda from a jealous conspiracy nut. Instead of condeming Obama it clarifies why we need more leaders like Obama!	0
Typical right wing fear mongering. D'Souza provides no evidence but some creative editing =. Not worth your time or money.	0
You might as well watch Fox News. This is the same garbage they shovel there. Nothing factual about any of it.	0
Well done! If you are curious about Obama and why he does what he does, this is the movie to see.	1
Don't buy these there free at any Bose store. Just show them your headphones and they'll give you new ones	0

Unfortunately, this item was not compatible to my tv. It may work for the newer, flat screens.	0
Easy to connect. Had to set the display Coles to get them to match the laptop. Once that was done, it was easy	1
Ive been waiting to get the Ferry Corsten-Tisto fusion CD long time. Its a great compilation for true Trance Lovers Fans.	1
I love the laser. I always cut crooked, even with the guide lines. The laser ensures a perfect cut each time!	1
It is the one I want. Black cord with silver heart. Beautiful.The package box is little rough.	1
Useless, unnecessary, and does not work. I bought because was cheap compared to the Laser Distance Measurer. I do not recommend.	0
I was on the edge of my seat on the last two episodes. Man that ws a thrilling season finale.	1

It makes you think life is not that complex as people make it to be. Sort of Keep It Simple Stupid.	1
what great value,i visited various stores, window shopping and these clogs,were as good as ,if not better than those available.	1
Bad acting, poor story line- and the worst of it all it's the [bad] actors are not even good looking. What gives!!!	0
Not a good game at all. No depth to the story line. The all around game play is choppy. Cheap version of Oblivion.	0
My daughter absolutely loves this show, and I do too. Its cute, educational, and fun to watch. I recommend to anyone.	1
Perfect for my 19x13 and smaller prints. the product is strong and seems like it will hold up to wear and tare.	1
What a great voice for a singer, but if I had known there was only one song on the CD -- buy a full CD somewhere else!	0
Sounds all right, but this is NOT a hybrid SACD, despite how it is listed on Amazon.	0
I love M.I.A. She experiments with music like a scientist does with lab rats. Crazy beats, untouchable energy I love it.	1

This book was very disappointing. I did not even finish it. It was not what I expected it to be.	0
This album was recorded in 1928, not 1991 as the description says. It is, obviously, not in stereo and is very scratchy.	0
The title say's it all, JUNK. Does not stick well at all. I learned my lesson the hard way. Stay away from this one.	0
This book is fantastic for anyone interested in Photography!! Truely worth buying! Even great as a coffee table book!	1

First: The Photographic Quality is first rate.Fine controls to get the right photo that you want when you need it.	1
I think these strings are great but what do I know Im a beginner at playing I would recommend them.	1
Good Cd and it places really well. I do like this sound track and it was just like the movie.	1

This is really a lovely remote, and once you set it up and try using it a bit, you will fall in love with it.	1
This is one of the greatest cds ever. If you like even 1 of the songs played on the radio from this cd, you'll like the cd.	1
they probably played for the last time together in this show.. the only disapointment is that it's only about an hour.	1
Great quality and fast delivery time.I have ordered from this company twice and will continue in the future.	1

These pur water filters are hard to find and expensive. This one was not, and it came when promised.	1
These fell apart in my hand the third time I used them. Maybe it's a case of getting what you pay for?	0
This book wrote about CDMA in a clear way for a layman. It makes a new comer feel easy.	1
A very patchy [and short] rant against Christianity, which loses its effect by its style. I much prefer other efforts.	0

this dryer is a piece of trash. it wouldn't even turn on the first time i tried to use it.	0
Good item to purchase if you purchase the Thule 682 box. It's a great system. They are sturdy bags on their own. Very satisfied.	1
Don't buy something just because it is made by a reputable company. Not worth the plastic it's made out of.	0
Great service. Arrived on time & as described. Haven't used it yet but that's my problem.	1

Easy to pair with automatic garage door opener. Great range so door opens in plenty of time. Came with battery.	1
The album was so so. It was a double album and I didn't like the second cd. They put the tunes to what I believe was a latin beat.	1
The item is good, easy to use & learn especially for a beginner like me.But had wish it came with an earphone.	1
Bizarre. Made no sense at all. Didn't seem to remotely resemble the description until the last few seconds and then it was WTF ?	0

Maybe it was better in the theatre but I thought Inception wasnt any better or worse than any other mind binder type of movie	0
Yes, this film is a mind bender but you have to pay attention. One of the best movies I've seen in awhile.	1
Inception is in my top 5 favorite movies! I love it. Everything about it is great!!!! Everyone should watch it.	1
I need to watch it again - but i think it was great. Definitely worth renting. Dicaprio was very convincing.	1
More self-serving tripe from the worst governor in Arizona's (if not the nation's) history.	0
Really good audio card. Used the crap out of mine. Might look on ebay for a better price though.	1
